Project background
==================

egon-data provides a transparent and reproducible open data based data processing pipeline for generating data models suitable for energy system modeling. The data is customized for the requirements of the research project eGo_n. The research project aims to develop tools for an open and cross-sectoral planning of transmission and distribution grids. For further information please visit the `eGo_n project website <https://ego-n.org/>`_.
egon-data is a further development of the `Data processing <https://github.com/openego/data_processing>`_ developed in the former research project `open_eGo <https://openegoproject.wordpress.com/>`_. It aims for an extensions of the data models as well as for a better replicability and manageability of the data preparation and processing. 
The resulting data set serves as an input for the optimization tools `eTraGo <https://github.com/openego/eTraGo>`_, `ding0 <https://github.com/openego/ding0>`_ and `eDisGo <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo>`_ and delivers for example data on grid topologies, demands/demand curves and generation capacities in a high spatial resolution. The outputs of egon-data are published under open source and open data licenses.
