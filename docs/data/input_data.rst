The data bundle is published on
`zenodo <https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/1167119>`_. It contains several data
sets, which serve as a basis for egon-data:

* Climate zones in Germany
* Data on eMobility individual trips of electric vehicles
* Spatial distribution of deep geothermal potentials in Germany
* Annual profiles in hourly resolution of electricity demand of private households
* Sample heat time series including hot water and space heating for single- and multi-familiy houses
* Hydrogen storage potentials in salt structures
* Information about industrial sites with DSM-potential in Germany
* Data extracted from the German grid development plan - power
* Parameters for the classification of gas pipelines
* Preliminary results from scenario generator pypsa-eur-sec
* German regions suitable to model dynamic line rating
* Eligible areas for wind turbines and ground-mounted PV systems
* Definitions of industrial and commercial branches
* Zensus data on households
* Geocoding of all unique combinations of ZIP code and municipality within the Marktstammdatenregister

For further description of the data including licenses and references please refer to the Zenodo repository.


Marktstammdatenregister
-----------------------

The `Marktstammdatenregister <https://www.marktstammdatenregister.de/MaStR>`_ (MaStR)
is the register for the German electricity and gas
market holding, among others, data on electricity and gas generation plants. In eGon-data
it is used for status quo data on PV plants, wind turbines, biomass, hydro power plants,
combustion power plants, nuclear power plants, geo- and solarthermal power plants, and storage units.
The data are obtained from zenodo, where raw MaStR data, downloaded with the tool
`open-MaStR <https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/open-MaStR>`_ using the MaStR webservice,
is provided. It contains all data from the MaStR, including possible duplicates.
Currently, two versions are used:

* `2021-05-03 <https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/1167119>`_
* `2022-11-17 <https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/1132839>`_
