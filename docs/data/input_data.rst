Data bundle

The data bundle is published on
`zenodo <https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/1167119>`_. It contains several data
sets, which serve as a basis for egon-data:

* Climate zones in Germany
* Data on eMobility individual trips of electric vehicles
* Spatial distribution of deep geothermal potentials in Germany
* Annual profiles in hourly resolution of electricity demand of private households
* Sample heat time series including hot water and space heating for single- and multi-familiy houses
* Hydrogen storage potentials in salt structures
* Information about industrial sites with DSM-potential in Germany
* Data extracted from the German grid development plan - power
* Parameters for the classification of gas pipelines
* Preliminary results from scenario generator pypsa-eur-sec
* German regions suitable to model dynamic line rating
* Eligible areas for wind turbines and ground-mounted PV systems
* Definitions of industrial and commercial branches
* Zensus data on households
* Geocoding of all unique combinations of ZIP code and municipality within the Marktstammdatenregister

For further description of the data including licenses and references please refer to the Zenodo repository.


Marktstammdatenregister
-----------------------

One such data set is the geocoding
for the `MaStR data set <https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/1132987>`_ which is
used for eGon-data as well. Whenever the MaStR data set is updated it is
necessary to redo the geocoding with the new data set and update the data
bundle accordingly. The geocoding can be done based on the
`mastr-geocoding repository <https://github.com/RLI-sandbox/mastr-geocoding>`_.
