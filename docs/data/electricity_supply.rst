The electrical power plants park, including data on geolocations, installed capacities, etc.
for the different scenarios is set up in the dataset
:class:`PowerPlants<egon.data.datasets.power_plants.PowerPlants>`.

Main inputs into the dataset are target capacities per technology and federal state
in each scenario (see :ref:`concept-and-scenarios-ref`) as well as the MaStR (see :ref:`mastr-ref`),
OpenStreetMap (see :ref:`osm-ref`) and potential areas (provided through the data bundle,
see :ref:`data-bundle-ref`) to distribute the generator capacities within each federal state region.
The approach taken to distribute the target capacities within each federal state differs for
the different technologies and is described in the following.
The final distribution in the eGon2035 scenario is shown in figure :ref:`generator-park-egon-2035`.
