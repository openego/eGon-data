The scenario eGon2035 includes the production of fossil methane and biogas. 
The potential supply of fossil methane in Germany stems from the *SciGRID_gas* dataset in the iteration 
*IGGIELGN* (https://zenodo.org/record/4767098). The potential for biogas production accords 
to the *Biogaspartner Einspeiseatlas* (https://www.biogaspartner.de/einspeiseatlas/). The supply cap 
for both, fossil methane and biogas, is derived from the *Netzentwicklungsplan (NEP) Gas 2020-2030* 
(https://fnb-gas.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fnb_gas_nep_gas_2020_de-1.pdf). 
For the neighboring countries gas supply has been linearly interpolated from the *TYNDP 2020* between the years 2030 and 2040.

For the eGon100RE scenario only biogas can be produced. The source for its potential production in Germany 
is also the *Biogaspartner Einspeiseatlas* but its maximum allowed production is derived from a 
*PyPSA-eur-sec* run. For the neighboring countries all data stems from the *PyPSA-eur-sec* run.
