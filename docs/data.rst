Published data
==============

Data bundle
-----------

The data bundle is published on
`zenodo <https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/1167119>`_. It contains several data
sets, which serve as a basis for egon-data. One such data set is the geocoding
for the `MaStR data set <https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/1132987>`_ which is
used for eGon-data as well. Whenever the MaStR data set is updated it is
necessary to redo the geocoding with the new data set and update the data
bundle accordingly. The geocoding can be done based on the
`mastr-geocoding repository <https://github.com/RLI-sandbox/mastr-geocoding>`_.
