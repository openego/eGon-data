Module containing the definition of the links between H2 and CH4 buses

In this module the functions used to define and insert into the database
the links between H2 and CH4 buses are to be found.
These links are modelling:
  * Methanisation (carrier name: 'H2_to_CH4'): technology to produce CH4
    from H2
  * H2_feedin: Injection of H2 into the CH4 grid
  * Steam Methane Reaction (SMR, carrier name: 'CH4_to_H2'): techonology
    to produce CH4 from H2

    Inserts methanisation, feed in and SMR links into the database

    Define the potentials for methanisation and Steam Methane Reaction
    (SMR) modelled as extendable links as well as the H2 feedin
    capacities modelled as non extendable links and insert all of them
    into the database.
    These tree technologies are connecting CH4 and H2 buses only.

    The capacity of the H2_feedin links is considerated as constant and
    calculated as the sum of the capacities of the CH4 links connected
    to the CH4 bus multiplied by the H2 energy share allowed to be fed.
    This share is calculated in the function :py:func:`H2_CH4_mix_energy_fractions`.

    """
    Calculate the fraction of H2 with respect to energy in a H2 CH4 mixture.

    Given the volumetric fraction of H2 in a H2 and CH4 mixture, the fraction
    of H2 with respect to energy is calculated with the ideal gas mixture law.
    Beware, that changing the fraction of H2 changes the overall energy within
    a specific volume of the mixture. If H2 is fed into CH4, the pipeline
    capacity (based on energy) therefore decreases if the volumetric flow
    does not change. This effect is neglected in eGon. At 15 vol% H2 the
    decrease in capacity equals about 10 % if volumetric flow does not change.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : float
        Volumetric fraction of H2 in the mixture
    T : int, optional
        Temperature of the mixture in °C, by default 25
    p : int, optional
        Pressure of the mixture in bar, by default 50
