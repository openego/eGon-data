Household electricity demand time series for scenarios in 2035 and 2050 at
census cell level.

Electricity demand data for households in Germany in 1-hourly resolution for
an entire year. Spatially, the data is resolved to 100 x 100 m cells and
provides individual and distinct time series for each household in a cell.
The cells are defined by the dataset Zensus 2011.

The resulting data is stored in two separate tables

* `demand.household_electricity_profiles_in_census_cells`:
  Lists references and scaling parameters to time series data for each
  household in a cell by identifiers. This table is fundamental for creating
  subsequent data like demand profiles on MV grid level or for determining
  the peak load at load area level.
  The table is created by:func:`houseprofiles_in_census_cells`.
* `demand.household_electricity_profiles_hvmv_substation`:
  Household electricity demand profiles aggregated at MV grid district level
  in MWh. Primarily used to create the eTraGo data model.
  The table is created with :func:`mv_grid_district_HH_electricity_load`.

The following datasets are used for creating the data:

* Electricity demand time series for household categories
  produced by demand profile generator (DPG) from Fraunhofer IEE
  (see :func:`get_iee_hh_demand_profiles_raw`)
* Spatial information about people living in households by Zensus 2011 at
  federal state level
    * Type of household (family status)
    * Age
    * Number of people
* Spatial information about number of households per ha, categorized by type
  of household (family status) with 5 categories (also from Zensus 2011)
* Demand-Regio annual household demand at NUTS3 level

**What is the goal?**

To use the electricity demand time series from the `demand profile generator`
to created spatially reference household demand time series for Germany at a
resolution of 100 x 100 m cells.

**What is the challenge?**

The electricity demand time series produced by demand profile generator offer
12 different household profile categories.
To use most of them, the spatial information about the number of households
per cell (5 categories) needs to be enriched by supplementary data to match
the household demand profile categories specifications. Hence, 10 out of 12
different household profile categories can be distinguished by increasing
the number of categories of cell-level household data.

**How are these datasets combined?**

* Spatial information about people living in households by zensus (2011) at
  federal state NUTS1 level :var:`df_zensus` is aggregated to be compatible
  to IEE household profile specifications.
    * exclude kids and reduce to adults and seniors
    * group as defined in :var:`HH_TYPES`
    * convert data from people living in households to number of households
      by :var:`mapping_people_in_households`
    * calculate fraction of fine household types (10) within subgroup of rough
      household types (5) :var:`df_dist_households`
* Spatial information about number of households per ha
  :var:`df_census_households_nuts3` is mapped to NUTS1 and NUTS3 level.
  Data is refined with household subgroups via
  :var:`df_dist_households` to :var:`df_census_households_grid_refined`.
* Enriched 100 x 100 m household dataset is used to sample and aggregate
  household profiles. A table including individual profile id's for each cell
  and scaling factor to match Demand-Regio annual sum projections for 2035
  and 2050 at NUTS3 level is created in the database as
  `demand.household_electricity_profiles_in_census_cells`.

**What are central assumptions during the data processing?**

* Mapping zensus data to IEE household categories is not trivial. In
  conversion from persons in household to number of
  households, number of inhabitants for multi-person households is estimated
  as weighted average in :var:`OO_factor`
* The distribution to refine household types at cell level are the same for
  each federal state
* Refining of household types lead to float number of profiles drew at cell
  level and need to be rounded to nearest int by np.rint().
* 100 x 100 m cells are matched to NUTS via cells centroid location
* Cells with households in unpopulated areas are removed

**Drawbacks and limitations of the data**

* The distribution to refine household types at cell level are the same for
  each federal state
* Household profiles aggregated annual demand matches Demand Regio demand at
  NUTS-3 level, but it is not matching the demand regio time series profile
* Due to secrecy, some census data are highly modified under certain attributes
 (quantity_q = 2). This cell data is not corrected, but excluded.
* There is deviation in the Census data from table to table. The statistical
 methods are not stringent. Hence, there are cases in which data contradicts.
* Census data with attribute 'HHTYP_FAM' is missing for some cells with small
 amount of households. This data is generated using the average share of
 household types for cells with similar household number. For some cells the
 summed amount of households per type deviates from the total number with
 attribute 'INSGESAMT'. As the profiles are scaled with demand-regio data at
 nuts3-level the impact at a higher aggregation level is negligible.
 For sake of simplicity, the data is not corrected.
* There are cells without household data but a population. A randomly chosen
 household distribution is taken from a subgroup of cells with same population
 value and applied to all cells with missing household distribution and the
 specific population value.
