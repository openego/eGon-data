Household electricity demand time series for scenarios in 2035 and 2050
assigned to OSM-buildings.

Assignment of household electricity demand timeseries to OSM buildings and
generation of randomly placed synthetic 5x5m buildings if no sufficient OSM-data
available in the respective cencus cell.

The resulting data is stored in separate tables

* `openstreetmap.osm_buildings_synthetic`:
    Lists generated synthetic building with id and cell_id
* `demand.egon_household_electricity_profile_of_buildings`:
    Mapping of demand timeseries and buildings including cell_id, building
    area and peak load

Both tables are created within :func:`map_houseprofiles_to_buildings`.


**The following datasets from the database are used for creation:**

* `demand.household_electricity_profiles_in_census_cells`:
    Lists references and scaling parameters to time series data for each
    household in a cell by identifiers. This table is fundamental for creating
    subsequent data like demand profiles on MV grid level or for determining
    the peak load at load. Only the profile reference and the cell identifiers
    are used.

* `society.egon_destatis_zensus_apartment_building_population_per_ha`:
    Lists number of apartments, buildings and population for each census cell.

* `boundaries.egon_map_zensus_buildings_residential`:
    List of OSM tagged buildings which are considered to be residential.


**What is the goal?**

To assign every household demand timeseries, which already exist at cell level,
to a specific OSM building.

**What is the challenge?**

The census and the OSM dataset differ from each other. The census uses
statistical methods and therefore lacks accuracy at high spatial resolution.
The OSM datasets is community based dataset which is extended throughout and
does not claim to be complete. By merging these datasets inconsistencies need
to be addressed. For example: not yet tagged buildings in OSM or new building
areas not considered in census 2011.

**How are these datasets combined?**

The assignment of household demand timeseries to buildings takes place at cell
level. Within each cell a pool of profiles exists, produced by the 'HH Demand"
module. These profiles are randomly assigned to a filtered list of OSM buildings
within this cell. Every profile is assigned to a building and every building
get a profile assigned if there is enough households by the census data. If
there are more profiles then buildings, all additional profiles are randomly
assigned. Therefore multiple profiles can be assigned to one building, making
it a multi-household building.


**What are central assumptions during the data processing?**

* Mapping zensus data to OSM data is not trivial. Discrepancies are substituted.
* Missing OSM buildings are generated by census building count.
* If no census building count data is available, the number of buildings is
derived by an average rate of households/buildings applied to the number of
households.

**Drawbacks and limitations of the data**

* Missing OSM buildings in cells without census building count are derived by
an average rate of households/buildings applied to the number of households.
As only whole houses can exist, the substitute is ceiled to the next higher
integer. Ceiling is applied to avoid rounding to amount of 0 buildings.

* As this datasets is a cascade after profile assignement at census cells
also check drawbacks and limitations in hh_profiles.py.
